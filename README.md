# STM32---Electronic-Speed-Controller---V1-DEMO
The first version as a proof of concept and schematic verification for a simple brushed and brushless ESC. Based around an STM32, this will be an open source project starting point that will soon be replaced by a fully self contained, fully functional ESC.
